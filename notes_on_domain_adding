- Now I get it

- Register domain with godaddy-person
- Point to the proper nameservers
- On your Digital Ocean Control Panel, add a domain (record)
- Create a new user (you'll be logged in as devbryce)
- Create a new file in the /etc/nginx/conf.d/ with the proper name: /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.conf,
 copy and paste the basic config from devbryce.com.conf and set a unique port for the app to listen to
 (not 8080, but still localhost).
- make sure the app is running.
    - That is, write a node server with .listen({UNIQUE_PORT}) and then begin running it with pm2
    - pm2 is easy -- just `pm2 start hello.js`
    - you can check to see if the app is listening with `pm2 list`
